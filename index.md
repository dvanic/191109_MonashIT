Over the last hundred years,
researchers have discovered an enormous amount about how people learn
and how best to teach them.
Unfortunately,
much of that knowledge has not yet been translated into common classroom practice, especially at the university level.

Over the next two days we will:

*   Introduce you to evidence-based best-practices of teaching.
*   Teach you how to create a positive environment in your workshops.
*   Provide opportunities for you to practice and build your teaching skills.
*   Help you become integrated into the Carpentries community. 
*   Prepare you to use these teaching skills in teaching workshops.

What we won't be learning:  
*   How to program in R or Python, use Git or SQL, or any of the other topics taught in Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, or Library Carpentry workshops. 
*   How to create your own lessons from scratch (although you will have a good start on the principles behind that sort of work, and I'm happy to point you to a few of my favourite resources.)

The class will be hands-on throughout:
short lessons will alternate with individual and group practical exercises,
including practice teaching sessions.
Those who complete the two full days
and [some short follow-up exercises online]({{ page.root }}/checkout/)
will be certified to teach [Software Carpentry]({{ site.swc_site }}), [Data Carpentry]({{ site.dc_site }}), and [Library Carpentry]({{ site.lc_site }}) workshops.

*   All participants in this course are required to abide by our Code of Conduct.
